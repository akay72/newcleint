1. What is the shape of the dataset?
Shape of the dataset: (5960, 13)

3. How does the distribution of years at present job "YOJ" vary across the dataset?


Loan applicants with a lower number of years at their present job are more common
than those with a longer job tenure. For example, there are 415 applicants who have
just started their current job (0 years), which is the largest group of applicants.



As the number of years at the present job increases, the frequency of loan applicants
tends to decrease. This pattern suggests that there are fewer loan applicants with a
longer job tenure in the dataset.



The distribution of YOJ values appears to be positively skewed, with the majority
of the data concentrated at the lower end of the range. This indicates that most loan
applicants in the dataset have relatively shorter job tenures.

4. Is there a relationship between the REASON variable and the proportion of
applicants who defaulted on their loan?

The relationship between the REASON variable and the proportion of applicants who
defaulted on their loan:




For loan applicants who requested a loan for debt consolidation (DebtCon), the
proportion of applicants who defaulted on their loan is approximately 18.97%.
For loan applicants who requested a loan for home improvement (HomeImp), the
proportion of applicants who defaulted on their loan is approximately 22.25%.
These results suggest that there is a slightly higher proportion of applicants who
defaulted on their loans when the reason for the loan is home improvement
compared to those who took the loan for debt consolidation.

5. Do applicants who default have a significantly different mortgage amount compared
to those who repay their loan?






The mean mortgage amount for defaulted loans is approximately 69,460.45.
The mean mortgage amount for repaid loans is approximately 74,829.25.
A t-test was performed to compare the mean mortgage amounts for the two groups, and
the results show a t-test statistic of -3.377 and a p-value of 0.00075. Since the p-value
is less than the commonly used significance level (alpha) of 0.05, we can conclude that
there is a statistically significant difference between the mean mortgage amounts for
defaulted loans and repaid loans.
In summary, applicants who default on their loans have, on average, a significantly
lower mortgage amount compared to those who successfully repay their loans.

Solution Step 2: Data Preprocessing:
6. Are there any patterns in the missing values for particular variables?


The DEBTINC variable has the highest number of missing values (1,267). It might
indicate that applicants are less likely to provide their debt-to-income ratio or this
information is harder to collect by loan providers.



The variables MORTDUE, YOJ, DEROG, DELINQ, CLAGE, and NINQ have a
significant number of missing values. These variables are related to the applicant's
credit history, and it might suggest that this information is either difficult to collect
or some applicants have not provided the information.



The categorical variables REASON and JOB have 252 and 279 missing values,
respectively. This may imply that some applicants have not provided this
information, or there were issues during data collection.

7. How to impute missing values for numerical and categorical variables?


Numerical variables: For numerical variables, I created a SimpleImputer object
with the strategy set to 'mean'. This object will be used to impute missing values
with the mean value of each numerical variable. The list of numerical variables
includes 'LOAN', 'MORTDUE', 'VALUE', 'YOJ', 'DEROG', 'DELINQ', 'CLAGE',
'NINQ', 'CLNO', and 'DEBTINC'. We use the fit_transform() function to impute
the missing values in the DataFrame for these variables.



Categorical variables: For categorical variables, I created a SimpleImputer object
with the strategy set to 'most_frequent', which means it will use the mode (most
frequent value) for imputing missing values. The list of categorical variables
includes 'REASON' and 'JOB'. We use the fit_transform() function to impute the
missing values in the DataFrame for these variables.

8. Do we need to normalise the data before splitting into train and test set?


Yes we need it.Normalizing the data can help improve the performance of some
machine learning models that are sensitive to the scale of input features. It's
recommended to normalize the data before splitting it into train and test sets to
ensure that both sets have the same scale.

Solution Step 3: Model Building:
9. Which algorithm can used to predict the target variables?
 I will use logistic regression as a linear algorithm and random forest as a non-linear
algorithm.
10. Is there any significant difference between the results linear and non linear
algorithms


Yes, there is a significant difference between the results of the linear and non-linear
algorithms on this dataset. The logistic regression, which is a linear algorithm,
achieved an accuracy of approximately 80.96%. In contrast, the random forest,
which is a non-linear algorithm, achieved a higher accuracy of about 91.44%.



The non-linear random forest algorithm outperforms the linear logistic regression
algorithm by around 10 percentage points in accuracy, indicating that the random
forest model is better at capturing the underlying patterns and relationships in the

dataset. This performance difference suggests that a non-linear algorithm might be
more suitable for this particular dataset than a linear one.

11. Does linear algorithm is easy to interpret as compared to non linear algorithms


Yes, generally, linear algorithms like logistic regression are easier to interpret than
non-linear algorithms like random forest. The reason for this is that linear
algorithms have a simpler structure and fewer parameters, making it easier to
understand how the algorithm is making predictions. The coefficients of the
features in a logistic regression model, for example, can provide insight into how
each feature affects the target variable.



In contrast, non-linear algorithms like random forest have more complex structures
and parameters that interact with each other in more intricate ways. This makes it
more difficult to understand how the algorithm is making its predictions. However,
even though non-linear algorithms are generally harder to interpret, they can often
achieve higher accuracy than linear algorithms on complex datasets

12. How to choose the parameters to optimise the algorithm


Choosing the optimal parameters for a machine learning algorithm is an essential
step in achieving the best possible performance. There are several techniques you
can use to tune the hyperparameters of your algorithm, including:



Grid Search: In grid search, you specify a set of possible values for each
hyperparameter, and the algorithm tries all possible combinations of these values
to determine the optimal set of hyperparameters that maximize performance.



Random Search: In random search, you randomly select values for each
hyperparameter from a specified range of possible values. This technique can be
more efficient than grid search when there are many hyperparameters to search
over.

What is the metric (Measure of Success) for this business problem?


The measure of success for this business problem is the accuracy of the predictive
model in identifying clients who are likely to default on their home equity loans.



The ultimate goal is to minimize the number of defaulters and reduce the financial
loss associated with defaults.
In this case, accuracy can be defined as the proportion of correctly identified
defaulters and non-defaulters in the test dataset.

Should we consider the trade-off between the interpretability and model performance to
choose the best model



Yes, we should consider the trade-off between the interpretability and model performance
when choosing the best model. A more interpretable model is often easier to understand
and explain to stakeholders, but it may sacrifice some level of performance compared to a
more complex, less interpretable model. On the other hand, a more complex and less
interpretable model may achieve better performance on the prediction task but may be
difficult to understand and explain to stakeholders.



The choice between interpretability and performance should be based on the specific goals
and requirements of the business problem. For example, if the goal is to understand the
factors that contribute to loan defaults and to take action to mitigate these risks, a more
interpretable model such as logistic regression may be a better choice, even if it sacrifices
some level of performance. Conversely, if the goal is to achieve the highest possible
prediction accuracy, a more complex model such as random forest or neural networks may
be a better choice, even if it sacrifices some level of interpretability.

What are the refined insights from EDA and model building?
The refined insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building for the loan default
prediction problem can be summarized as follows:
EDA insights:







There are missing values in the dataset, which were imputed using appropriate methods
such as mean imputation for numerical variables and mode imputation for categorical
variables.
The dataset is imbalanced, with only 20% of clients experiencing a loan default. This
should be taken into account when selecting evaluation metrics and building the model.
The mortgage amount appears to be a significant factor in predicting loan defaults, with
defaulted clients having a lower average mortgage amount compared to those who repaid
their loans.
The distribution of years at present job (YOJ) varies across the dataset, with a majority of
clients having less than 10 years of experience at their current job.

Model building insights:





Random forest model achieved a higher accuracy compared to logistic regression model in
predicting loan defaults.
The precision and recall for identifying loan defaults were higher in random forest
compared to logistic regression.
There is a trade-off between model interpretability and performance, with logistic
regression being more interpretable but less accurate compared to random forest.
Overall, the refined insights from EDA and model building suggest that the mortgage
amount is an important factor in predicting loan defaults, and that random forest is a better
choice for building a predictive model for this problem. The insights also suggest that there
is a trade-off between model interpretability and performance, and that the choice between
these factors should be made based on the specific requirements and constraints of the
business problem.

What observations and insights can be drawn from the confusion matrix and classification
report?
The confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into the performance of the models
in predicting loan defaults. The classification report shows the precision, recall, and F1-score for
each class (0 and 1), as well as the overall accuracy of the model. The confusion matrix shows the
number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each model.
 From the classification reports, we can see that both models have higher precision and
recall for loans that will be repaid (class 0) compared to loans that will default (class 1).
This suggests that the models are better at predicting loans that will be repaid compared to
loans that will default.
 The accuracy of the logistic regression model is 0.81, which is lower than the accuracy of
the random forest model (0.91). This suggests that the random forest model is better at
predicting the target variable than the logistic regression model.
 The F1-score is a weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, and is often used as a
measure of the overall performance of a classification model. In this case, the F1-score for
class 1 is lower than the F1-score for class 0 in both models, suggesting that the models are
more accurate at predicting loans that will be repaid compared to loans that will default.
 Looking at the confusion matrices, we can see that the random forest model has more true
positives and fewer false negatives than the logistic regression model. This suggests that
the random forest model is better at predicting loans that will default than the logistic
regression model.
In summary, both models have higher precision and recall for loans that will be repaid, and are
less accurate at predicting loans that will default. The random forest model has a higher accuracy
than the logistic regression model and is better at predicting loan defaults, with a higher number
of true positives and lower number of false negatives.
Is the model performance good enough for deployment in production?









Whether or not a model is good enough for deployment in production depends on the
specific requirements of the business problem at hand, as well as the acceptable level of
risk and error for the task.
In this case, the accuracy of the random forest model is 0.91, which is relatively high and
suggests that the model can make accurate predictions for the target variable. However, it's
important to note that the model is more accurate at predicting loans that will be repaid
compared to loans that will default, which may be a concern depending on the specific
business problem.
Additionally, it's important to consider the potential consequences of false positives and
false negatives, as well as the potential impact of model errors on the overall business
objective. For example, if the business objective is to minimize losses from loan defaults,
false negatives (where the model incorrectly predicts that a loan will be repaid when it
actually defaults) could have a significant impact on the business outcome.
Therefore, before deploying the model in production, it's important to conduct a thorough
evaluation of the model performance and consider the potential consequences of model
errors in the specific business context. It may also be necessary to continue to monitor and
refine the model over time to ensure that it continues to perform well and meets the
evolving needs of the business problem.

What is proposal for final solution design? What are expected benefits and costs (assume
numbers) of this solution design?
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to gain insights into the relationships
between variables and the overall patterns of the data. This can be done through
visualizations and statistical analysis.
 Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and
outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.
 Model Building: Train and evaluate different machine learning models such as logistic
regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to identify the best model for
the task. This will involve tuning hyperparameters and optimizing the model for
performance.
 Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the selected model using appropriate
evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
